## Overview

The **Yadav Fallback Operator** (`⁊`) is a symbolic construct proposed to elegantly capture fallback logic—a fundamental pattern across disciplines where a primary value is used, but if it's undefined or invalid, an alternative is chosen.

Though this logic is widely used in programming languages (`??`, `?:`, `coalesce`) and mathematics (default values, conditional definitions), a **dedicated symbol** has never been standardized. This proposal introduces one.

## The Operator: `⁊`

### Definition

For any two expressions `a` and `b`, the operator:

```
a ⁊ b
```

is interpreted as:

> “Use `a` if it is defined or valid; otherwise, use `b`.”

### Properties

- **Non-commutative**: `a ⁊ b ≠ b ⁊ a`
- **Left-associative**: `a ⁊ b ⁊ c` ≡ `(a ⁊ b) ⁊ c`
- **Short-circuit evaluation**: returns the first valid/defined operand

---

## Use Cases

### Mathematics

```math
x_i = A[i] ⁊ 0
```

- Use `A[i]` if defined, fallback to 0 otherwise.

### Programming

```python
username = user_input ⁊ cached_username ⁊ "Guest"
```

- Use user input if available, else cached name, else fallback to "Guest".

### Data Science

```python
score = row.get("score") ⁊ average_score ⁊ 0
```

- Handles missing data in cascading fashion.

### Probabilities & Models

```math
P(x) = P_model(x) ⁊ P_backup(x) ⁊ Uniform(x)
```

- Hierarchical modeling with graceful degradation.

## Why `⁊`?

The symbol used is the **Tironian Et** (`⁊`, Unicode U+204A), historically a shorthand for "and". It's visually distinct, underutilized, and symbolically resonant with logical fallback and flow.

### Advantages:
- Already in Unicode
- Minimal and clean
- Typable in most editors
- Can be redefined in LaTeX and code

---

## LaTeX Integration

Include this in your preamble:

```latex
\newcommand{\fallback}{\ensuremath{\text{\textit{⁊}}}}
```

Usage:

```latex
f(x \fallback 0)
```

## Syntax Comparison

| Use Case             | Traditional Syntax             | With ⁊ Operator     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Fallback             | `a ?? b`, `a ?: b`             | `a ⁊ b`             |
| Multi-tier fallback  | `a ?? b ?? c`                  | `a ⁊ b ⁊ c`         |
| Math defaulting      | `x = a if defined else b`      | `x = a ⁊ b`         |
| Nullable logic       | `x if x != null else y`        | `x ⁊ y`             |
